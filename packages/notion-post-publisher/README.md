WIP ...

TODO:

- [ ] See https://github.com/seancdavis/seancdavis-com/issues/460#issuecomment-1097907450 for some thoughts
- [ ] Write out this readme
- [ ] Change the name of the gh workflow and delete the CI flow.
- [ ] (IF that works, delete the other ones that were just for testing)

Working notes:

- Images use the caption as the alt attribute. Rich text is not supported.
- .prerender() and how all that rendering works -- would be good to note
- Emoji map for callouts
