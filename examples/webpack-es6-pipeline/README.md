# Simple JavaScript Pipeline with webpack

This is a simple example of a JavaScript build pipeline using webpack. It exists to support [this tutorial](https://www.seancdavis.com/blog/javascript-webpack-build-pipeline/).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

    $ npm install

The webpack server and web server run in separate processes. In one terminal session, run this command to start the webpack server:

    $ npm run dev

In another, run this command to start the web server:

    $ npm run serve

Then the site will be running at localhost:8000.
