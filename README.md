# Sean C Davis

Hi, I'm Sean! This is my website. I prefer to work out in the open and share my work with anyone who may benefit from it. This repo has the code and content that powers my site, including some of the examples I use in blog posts.

## Contributing

I don't just work out in the open because it looks cool. I would love your help in keeping this website useful to its readers. I welcome any form of contribution to this site, including:

- Share some love [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/seancdavis29)

- Comments, feedback, and bug reports via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/seancdavis/seancdavis-com/issues)
- Fixes to silly typos, adjustments to outdated code examples, or other wild ideas via [a pull request](https://github.com/seancdavis/seancdavis-com/pulls)

## License

I don't use a typical software license. I'm here to make the web better and to have some fun doing it! You can [read my license page](https://www.seancdavis.com/license/) for those fine-grained, nitty-gritty, legal(ish) details.
