Most of the messages I receive are about getting sponsored content onto the site. The sections below describe how I work with sponsored content.

## Link Sharing

I'm open to mutual link sharing to boost our collective SEO **if it is relevant to the content.** I will not add spammy links to this site, nor would I like my site linked to in spammy ways.

To add your link to this site, you can:

- [Open a pull request](https://github.com/seancdavis/seancdavis-com#contributing) with your link on the appropriate post.
- [Send me a message](/contact) with the link you'd like to share and the exact post and location in which it should be placed.

Before accepting the request, you must also tell me where on your site you are linking back to my site. This must also be relevant to your audience and not spammy.

## Sponsored Content

I do accept sponsored content. You can contribute a post to the site that promotes your project or product.

To do so, follow [the guest writing guide](/guest-writing), but note when you submit your proposal that it is a sponsored post. Note: Sponsored content must still adhere to the guidelines of the content on this site. It must _help developers build better websites through tips, tricks, tutorials, and so much more_.

Cost is $250 per post, which covers:

- My time editing and publishing the post.
- A mention of the post on Twitter.

## Writing on Your Behalf

I'm also available to write content that promotes your product or project on your behalf. This content can be published on this site or other platforms or publications. See [the _hire me_ page](/hire-me) for details.

## Advertisements

There are currently no advertisements on this site. I'm open to direct ads. Please [contact me](/contact) for details.
