# TODO:
#
# - [ ] Add component with transformer that adds a tag badge to the original post
# - [ ] Add mapping to external post base urls
# - [ ] Use "Posted from [mapping]" as the tag text
# - [ ] Add colors to mapping
# - [ ] Add colors to tag
# - [ ] Place remaining guest posts somewhere?

# - [ ] Or maybe treat "Reposted from Grouparoo" as a tag (with color), and then
#   have a separate note within the post body with the original URL.
#     - There's more of a foundation in place to make this move quicker.
#     - And it has the added benefit of a page for all posts from that source.

# - [ ] Ask permission from Ample to repost
# - [ ] Repost the Sanity article. (There is markdown content on Dev.to)
