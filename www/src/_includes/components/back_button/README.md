# Back Button

This button is currently not being used.

Previously it sat above feed page titles as a way to get "back" to the blog. But now there are multiple feeds and we can't statically determine where someone came from.

I'm leaving this around because the styles look nice and it could be a bases for a _button link_ or _icon button_ sort of component.
