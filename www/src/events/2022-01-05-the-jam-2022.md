This event is back for the second year with a great lineup that includes [Charlie Gerard](https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie), [Fred K Schott](https://twitter.com/fredkschott), [Brian Douglas](https://twitter.com/bdougieYO), [Colby Fayock](https://twitter.com/colbyfayock), and more!

But what I'm most excited about: I'm going to join CFE's Brian Rinaldi as the host for the second half of each day!

Last year this was a paid event, and thanks to the involvement of so many sponsors, CFE and FITC were able to make this event happen without any cost to attend. I hope you'll join me on what is surely to be an interesting and informative ride.
