## Where Can You Use Animation?

Animations and short videos present information more vividly than static publications. Any message can be packaged into animation, with its help you can explain complex things as simply as possible.

Here are four ways to use animation:

- **Social media and advertising.** [Animating](/blog/animated-dot-background-canvas/) ads and posts get more attention and are more informative. Relatively speaking, here instead of one frozen slide, you get several linked frames – a long story packed in a couple of seconds.
- **Educational videos.** The use of flash animations while [editing video](https://www.movavi.com/videoeditor/) increases interest in the topic being studied, improves the quality of the educational process and contributes to the development of research skills. A static image becomes much clearer if we see a tutorial animation instead.
- **Websites.** On a website, animations can solve a number of specific problems. One of them is filling in the time that the user has to wait for the page to load. Looking at a static page is not as interesting as looking at a beautiful animation. As a result, those users who could leave the website remain on it – and as a result, the conversion grows.
- **Short-series cartoons.** Remember the success of Rick and Morty? Well, there is no need for further explanation.

## Wrap Up

Animations are useful in a wide variety of situations. Therefore, if you doubt whether to study it or not, just stop doubting. And with the above-mentioned software, everything will become even easier. Good luck!
