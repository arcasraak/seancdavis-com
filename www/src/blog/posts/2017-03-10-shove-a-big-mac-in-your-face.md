Life as a human is hard.

We're constantly at work, attempting to:

- Earn enough money to be comfortable
- Create and maintain loving human relationships
- Find a balance between work and play
- Improve our craft(s)
- Eat healthy
- Exercise to stay fit

The list goes on. And on. And on.

The role of _being a good human_ will never cease to demand more.

You're doing a great job! Believe in yourself and keep pushing yourself to do better.

But don't forget to take a break from it all and shove a [Big Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac) in your face every once in awhile.
