## My Updates

_Notable changes in my life, [on my website](https://github.com/seancdavis/seancdavis-com), and in other projects._ {.text-sm}

Last month I launched [Unmute](https://www.unmutedstories.com/) alongside [three fellow nerds I know and love](https://www.unmutedstories.com/about/), [Becky Blank](https://twitter.com/beckysblank), Brandon Blank, and [Ryan Cayabyab](https://twitter.com/rcayabyab).

Unmute is a storytelling platform for underrepresented folx in the tech community. We're not really sure what it's going to end up being, but for now we're planning to host a series of (free) events for the community.

This project is the culmination of two things in my life: 1) My desire to use my privilege to help those less represented in the industry, and 2) A way to get back into storytelling after discontinuing [the ridiculous podcast](https://www.squirrelstories.fm/) I ran for a few years.

## My Words

_New blog posts and videos I published last month._ {.text-sm}

As expected, April was a slow month for me. We welcomed our second child early in the month, and I didn't really find a groove to writing again until the month neared its end.

Of the four articles I published, I'm really excited about two:

- In [10 Unspoken Truths on Being a Developer](/blog/10-unspoken-developer-truths/), I added some commentary to a particularly valuable series of tweets from [@laurieontech](https://twitter.com/laurieontech).
- [Components: They Take a Village](/blog/components-they-take-the-village/) is helping me get back into the habit of writing about components, as I mentioned last month.

And here are a couple other quick hits on JavaScript:

- [Converting FormData to JSON in JavaScript](/blog/convert-form-data-to-json/)
- [Incrementing Variables in JavaScript](/blog/incrementing-variables-javascript/)

## My Reads

_Articles and news I read last month that I found interesting, with some commentary._ {.text-sm}

{% post_image

I found _so many_ great articles in April that I started wondering if I should be running a weekly newsletter. There's a lot to get through here, so I tried to bucket them for you.

### Product Updates

Here are a few updates from products I've come to love:

- Netlify began talking about [Distributed Persistent Rendering](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/04/14/distributed-persistent-rendering-a-new-jamstack-approach-for-faster-builds/) as an approach for achieving faster builds without losing the benefits presented by the Jamstack. I love this idea, mostly because it works to better define what is (and what isn't) a Jamstack site (an idea I'm exploring for a post later this month).
- Netlify then released early access for a new feature that implements DPR, [On-demand Builders](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/04/14/faster-builds-for-large-sites-on-netlify-with-on-demand-builders-now-in-early-access/).
- Sanity talked about their [Content Lake](https://www.sanity.io/blog/content-is-data-announcing-sanity-content-lake). I really like reading Sanity's stuff because they think about content management different than most CMS providers. They put the content before the website.

### Headless CMS

For some reason, I came across a large number of articles in the headless CMS space. There's some overlap here, but all worth a read (or at least a skim to see if it's relevant to you):

- [Don't Lose Your Head: Evaluating Headless](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/evaluating-headless/)
- [Going Headless: Use Cases And What It's Good For](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/going-headless-use-cases/)
- [How to develop the right content modeling strategy](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2021/04/05/develop-content-model-strategy/)

### Static Site Generators

We can't talk about headless CMS without a little bit of SSG:

- [A Complete Guide To Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) With Next.js](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/incremental-static-regeneration-nextjs/)
- [A Deep Dive Into Eleventy Static Site Generator](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/eleventy-static-site-generator/)
- [When NOT to choose Next.js](https://blog.pankaj.pro/when-not-to-choose-nextjs-ckmknbfby003n7ws1h6n8fzxa)

### SEO & Performance

Odds and ends on the subject:

- [An In-Depth Guide To Measuring Core Web Vitals](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/complete-guide-measure-core-web-vitals/)
- [Jamstack SEO Guide: The Ultimate Guide For Beginners](https://bejamas.io/blog/jamstack-seo-guide/)
- [Make Your Jest Tests up to 20% Faster by Changing a Single Setting](https://ivantanev.com/make-jest-faster/?utm_campaign=Frontend%2BWeekly&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=Frontend_Weekly_249)

### Fun with JavaScript

JavaScript is ... _weird_. Really weird. Here is a collection of new resources to help you understand and work efficiently with JavaScript:

- [3 Ways to Make Better Use of the JavaScript Console](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/javascript-tips-3-ways-to-use-the-console-in-a-better-way-49c95d008080)
- [7 JavaScript Features You Probably Don't Know](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/7-javascript-features-nobody-is-talking-about-4bf61297628c)
- [8 JavaScript Tips & Tricks That No One Teaches](https://dev.to/worldindev/8-javascript-tips-tricks-that-no-one-teaches-24g1)
- [JavaScript best practices to improve code quality](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/improve-javascript-code-quality-with-these-best-practices-ee883a124d8e)
- [Solving a Mystery Behavior of parseInt() in JavaScript](https://dmitripavlutin.com/parseint-mystery-javascript/)
- [Vanilla JavaScript Code Snippets — Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/vanilla-javascript-code-snippets/)

### On the Human Part

Something I don't talk about enough is the process of getting a job (i.e. making money) in the tech space, which is ... _a whole thing_. Here are a few articles in that vein:

- [6 Different Ways I Make Money as a Software Developer — You Can Too](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/6-different-ways-i-make-money-as-a-software-developer-you-can-too-d88aa31dd537)
- [50 JavaScript Output-related Interview Questions](https://codecrunch.org/50-javascript-output-questions-818d45c3e381)
- [Seven Mistakes To Avoid In Your Technical Interviews](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/mistakes-technical-interviews/)

### Case Studies

I don't usually like to read case studies. They are often super self-back-patting pieces, when I want to read to learn something. I found these two to be particularly insightful because they teach more than they promote:

- [Choosing A New Serverless Database Technology At An Agency](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/choosing-new-serverless-database-technology-agency/) (Sponsored by Fauna)
- [Moving Backlinko.com to Headless WordPress and Next.js](https://bejamas.io/blog/backlinko-case-study/) (Bejamas)

## My Finds

_New tools that I've recently discovered. They aren't necessarily new._ {.text-sm}

{% post_image
    src="/blog/210511/the-spinneret--my-finds.png",
    alt="The Spinneret - My Finds" %}

I also found _a lot_ of new tools this month. These are listed in alphabetical order with a quick snippet about each.

- [CodeTour](https://github.com/microsoft/codetour): _VS Code extension that allows you to record and play back guided tours of codebases, directly within the editor_. Not sure I'd use it, but it's a cool idea.
- [Clerk](https://www.clerk.dev/): _Simple and beautiful user management_. It appears to be an auth solution for front-end projects. I'm definitely interested in looking more at this.
- [Explosiv](https://vixalien.ga/post/explosiv): _The most lightweight, yet fully featured static-site generator you'll see._
- [FoalTS](https://foalts.org/): _Node.JS framework for building web applications_. Is it _yet another framework?_ I'm not sure, but I have a project in planning stages and am likely to start evaluating Node.js frameworks soon, so I'll let you know if I learn anything interesting.
- [Hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp): _The tiny framework for building hypertext applications._ I've seen some talking about this as a React killer. I'm skeptical, but it is off to a good start.
- [Mine](https://saymine.com/): _The Future of Data Ownership_. Okay, now _this one_ I tried out. And it is equal parts _awesome_ and _terrifying_. It's also only going to be free for a limited time.
- [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) is a module for Node.js applications to allow easy as cake email sending that pairs nicely with [Ethereal](https://ethereal.email/), a fake SMTP service. I used these in combination for an upcoming tutorial.
- [Porter](https://www.getporter.dev/): _A modern app platform in your own cloud_. It's basically a way to orchestrate AWS in such a way that it behaves like Heroku. We're using it at Grouparoo. And so far, so good.
- [StepZen](https://stepzen.com/): _A GraphQL API for Any Data Source in Minutes_. This seems to follow the approach I took in my Next.js conference talk, _Everything is a CMS!_ I've requested an invitation but haven't played around with it yet.
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io/): _The Open SourceFirebase Alternative_. This is super intriguing for me. I haven't had a need to play with this yet, but have been looking for an excuse.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): _Next Generation Frontend Tooling_. It appears to be a build tool for JS projects. Very interested to try this out.
