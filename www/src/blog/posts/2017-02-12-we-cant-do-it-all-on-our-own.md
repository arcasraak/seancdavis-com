Trees are pretty simple, right? They [compete for sunlight](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/how-plants-compete-for-sunlight/story-MrCTSibJPrrJGyqeJpMGNL), in the most simplistic sense. You can learn the age of a tree by [cutting a cross-section through it](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_ring) (which also leads to insights on the climate during its lifetime). They need light and water. There's something called [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis) -- a process I forget immediately upon graduating high school-that helps us humans breathe.

Trees are good. But simple.

I recently listened to [this story](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/from-tree-to-shining-tree), and it changed my mind about the simplicity of trees. And just yesterday I came across [Suzanne Simard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Simard)'s research again in [a TED Radio Hour episode](https://www.npr.org/2017/01/13/509350471/how-do-trees-collaborate).

It turns out, trees are incredibly complex. They have a vast communication network underground. They don't compete, they work together. It isn't survival of the fittest, but of the group as a whole. And there are even [mother trees that recognize and protect their kin](https://inhabitat.com/mother-trees-recognize-kin-and-send-them-messages-of-wisdom/).

Listening to these stories (I'd suggest [the RadioLab story](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/from-tree-to-shining-tree) if you're going to listen to one) got me thinking that if _trees_ -- this simple beasts of pure nature -- need one another to survive, how can we -- _complex human beings_ -- possibly think we can do it all on our own?

Whether it's running a household, building the next great app, writing a book, fighting for freedom, or working to remove Donald Trump from office, we can't do it alone.

It's important to reflect that even if you _think_ you're doing something on your own, it likely took thousands (or maybe _millions_) of people for you to be able to do what you are doing. If it's a house and you're on your own, think of everything you need to make the house function-appliances, insulation, a mattress. You didn't invent and you (probably) didn't build any of them. Likewise, it's unlikely that you're going to build an app without a computer, or write a book without paper (or a computer), or lead a political stance without a massive human following.

Take a moment in your day to appreciate _that_ -- that you couldn't be doing what you're doing without other people.

And recognize that if you really, truly want to succeed in this life, it's going to take help -- help from other people.

Ask for the help you need, then succeed.
