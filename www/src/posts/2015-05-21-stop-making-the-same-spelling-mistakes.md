You know your set of words.

You start typing a word and you just know ... _that squiggly red line is going to appear when I hit the space bar_.

And then you see the squiggly red line, and you right-click on the word and you replace it with the word you wanted to spell.

And then it happens again.

And again.

And again.

Make it stop!

Some words you just don't type much and you can let the computer help you out. But, if you frequently misspell a word, instead of letting the computer spell it for you, try respelling it until you don't see your squiggly friend.

Like a GPS device only helps you get to your destination one time, the computer only helps you correctly spell the word once. You need to put in a little effort if you want to actually learn how to spell the word (or get back to your friend's house).
