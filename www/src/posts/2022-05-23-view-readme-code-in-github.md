File this under _how in the world did I not know this?_

Iâ€™ve always appreciated that GitHub shows the rendered version of a markdown file by default, but I was also annoyed because I thought the only way to view the code was to go to the raw file.

Turns out there is a fancy little button toggle to switch between preview and code mode when viewing a markdown file in GitHub.
