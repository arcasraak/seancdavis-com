In my current web design project I've been flipping among several programs and, consequently, have been working with several color schema (mostly RGB and hex). Fortunately I found [this handy tool](http://www.javascripter.net/faq/rgbtohex.htm) for converting from RGB to hex, along with [its counterpart](http://www.javascripter.net/faq/hextorgb.htm) for hex to RGB.
