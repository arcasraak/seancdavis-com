Notion is an incredibly powerful content editing platform. There are so many features, I couldn’t possibly outline everything I use on a regular basis.

Instead, what I’ve included here is a collection of tips and tricks that I use regularly but which I also don’t see others using much. And because I’m authoring this post in Notion, I’ve recorded quick demos along the way.

## 1. Use `cmd`+`shift` to Quickly Move Blocks

Put your cursor anywhere in a document. Then hold down `cmd+`+`shift` and hit the up or down arrow. This will move the current block up or down in your page.

{% post_image alt="", src="/uploads/220520/Untitled.gif" %}

You can even highlight and move multiple blocks at the same time.

{% post_image alt="", src="/uploads/220520/Untitled.gif" %}

Make note that this gets a little weird with nested blocks like lists, as Notion bounces you around indentation levels. It takes a bit to get the hang of it, but eventually you’ll be using this shortcut all the time!

## 2. Use `cmd`+`d` to Duplicate Blocks

The `cmd`+`d` shortcut is my second favorite shortcut. It duplicates the current block(s) and inserts them just below on the page.

This is particularly helpful when you have a combination of items that you may want to see multiple times on the page.

{% post_image alt="", src="/uploads/220520/Untitled.gif" %}

## 3. Favor the Slash Command Over the Mouse

Using the mouse to create blocks is so not you. Instead, type `/` to bring up the blocks context menu to add a new block to your page.

{% post_image alt="", src="/uploads/220520/Untitled.gif" %}

Hitting `esc` removes the menu for those pesky times when you actually want to be typing a slash on your page.

And you can also change existing blocks using the slash command. I use this to change background colors or change the type of block.

{% post_image alt="", src="/uploads/220520/Untitled.gif" %}

## 4. Add Children to Quotes and Callouts

Most blocks can accept children in Notion. This is especially helpful with blocks that are specifically formatted, like quotes and callouts.

When I first started using Notion, I would add multi-line callouts using `shift`+`enter`. But it turns out, you can use the trick from #1 to move blocks into the callout. These are _technically_ children of the callout, but they appear at the same level.

{% post_image alt="", src="/uploads/220520/Untitled.gif" %}

## 5. Use Shortcuts for New Blocks

Although the slash command is powerful, some blocks can be [created using keyboard shortcuts](https://www.notion.so/help/keyboard-shortcuts), which can be faster than using the slash command.

{% post_image alt="", src="/uploads/220520/Untitled.gif" %}

## 6. Put Old Content in a Toggle Menu

You can use the combined tricks from #1 and #4 to hide old content away in a collapsible section. I prefer doing this when actively iterating, rather than having to dig through old versions of a document.

{% post_image alt="", src="/uploads/220520/Untitled.png" %}

## 7. Use Template Buttons for Repeatable Content

There are some Notion pages that I want to behave similarly and I want content structured or styled in a specific way. This is where [template buttons](https://www.notion.so/help/template-buttons) come in handy.

The biggest downside to template buttons is that they have to be tied to a template. That means you can’t _just_ create reusable blocks. Instead, you must first have a reusable template, then you can unlock this feature. For that reason, I don’t use this as much as the others in this list.

## 8. Use Empty Background (and Horizontal Lines) to Separate Sections

One trick I love is to do some stylistic breaking up of content using an empty block with a background color in combination with horizontal lines. I love this because it uses the tools we have available to us to create something visually useful.

{% post_image alt="", src="/uploads/220520/Untitled.png" %}

And this is just an example. There’s much you could do stylistically to your benefit by using blocks in a different way than they were intended.
