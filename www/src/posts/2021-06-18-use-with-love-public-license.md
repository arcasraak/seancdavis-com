My inclination on most new software I create is to jump right to adding [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). But with my website, I felt differently.

While consolidating content into this personal blog, I came across [the CSS-Tricks license](https://css-tricks.com/license/) and I loved it! In particular, I loved the attitude of _take it, use it for good, share it_. It helped me realize that getting all bent out of shape about some jackass who is going to wholesale copy articles is probably not worth it.

## My Original License

My site is nowhere near the level of traffic of CSS-Tricks. But I still wanted to (re)start on a similar footing. So I put [this license content](https://github.com/seancdavis/seancdavis-com/blob/7846b3409f80880e01b4be35e43d91976ffa1eb9/src/pages/license.md) together and presented it as a page on the site.

A few months later, I received an email from some organization that suggest I license my code by dropping a `LICENSE` file in the repository, which I then realized I totally forgot to do.

## Looking for a New License

When looking around for licenses, I started with MIT once again. But it just felt too open. I'm perfectly fine with anyone taking code examples or the site layout, but I don't really want to copyright infringement on my copy or my brand. Those are the things that make this site what it is. And what it is (as I write this) is a series of articles written to help the community. I don't make any money from this work (at this time).

So I looked for some other creative approaches. I found [The _Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License_](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/) and the modified [_Don't Be a Dick Public License_](https://dbad-license.org/). I love them. They are funny, and get to the point. But I didn't really want to be super snarky with the legal text. I can save that for the modified page.

## The "Use With Love" License

So I took all four of those texts (MIT, CSS, WTFPL, DBAD) and combined them into something that works for me.

Here's what it looks like at the time of writing:

```
