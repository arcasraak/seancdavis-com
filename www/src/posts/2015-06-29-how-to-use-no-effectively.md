I was going to title this article _The Power of No_, and then I found out [it's a book](http://smile.amazon.com/dp/1401945872). And it appears to be written on the subject I'm here to discuss.

The word _no_, or really the meaning behind the word, has a lot of power, as long as you use it and react to it correctly. Let's look at using _no_ and reacting to _no_, and how both situations can lead to happiness and confidence.

## Saying _Yes_

Let's begin this post on saying _no_ by discussing saying _yes_. Or, more importantly, when saying _yes_ can be detrimental.

In working for a client services agency, I've seen and heard my fair share of ridiculous requests. I look at these situations from the client's perspective and I totally get it. Why wouldn't you ask for everything and see if you can just get it? It works all over the place. When you get your next bill from your doctor, call the office and ask if you can have a discount if you pay in cash right now. I'm serious. I bet you get one.

Of course, you can see how if you continue to say _yes_ to what becomes the equivalent of free work, your going to run yourself right out of business. And yes, this opens up a can of worms, and we could spend all day exploring how sometimes you have to say yes to smooth over a rough patch in your relationship. I don't care much for that conversation, so guess what? _No_, I'm not going to talk about it.

Anyways, I see it a lot. At work. At home. With friends. With family. People say _yes_ and then they either can't deliver or they are completely miserable during the delivery process, of whatever that may consist.

That's _why_ we have to learn to say _no_. And now we need to figure out _how_ and _when_ to say it.

## How To Say _No_

I find the word _no_ to be powerful on its own. It's simple, precise, and direct. And because of that, it can also be viewed as cold or mean.

When you need to be firm, stop dancing around the issue. Say _no_. Literally, say, "No."

The problem is if you literally use _no_ too much, you start to come off as a dick. When you can get your point across by _implying_ you mean _no_, then you can be a little more savvy about it.

I've also found that no matter _how_ you say _no_, giving context to why you are saying no is important. Even if you say _no_, it's good to follow it with _because ..._.

## When To Say _No_

I'm all about the purpose behind any action you take. Finding purpose behind an action leads clarity of the action itself.

If you're going to say _no_ to someone, you need to be the first one to understand _why_. The whole _think before you speak_ adage is relevant here. Verify your purpose before you say _no_.

Let's say your boss asks you to send them a report by the end of the day. What should you do? Here are a few examples:

- If your boss is reading the report in preparation for a big meeting tomorrow, send the report.
- If you know your boss won't read the report until tomorrow, don't say _no_, but tell them you'll have the report by 10 tomorrow.
- If your boss never reads the reports, ask them why you are running the reports in the first place. If it's a formality, maybe you shouldn't even be doing it.

You can take the same approach at home, too. Just pay very close attention to the _purpose_, because it's all about the purpose. Let's say your spouse asks you to empty the dishwasher _tonight_. Does it have to be tonight? Why? Or, is it even worth creating the argument over (should you just do it because it only takes five minutes?).

Never use _no_ without a purpose. And avoid making that purpose something stupid like _to win an argument_ or _to stand up for yourself_. It's important to understand you don't say _no_ to stay up for yourself. You stand up for yourself by saying _no_ for some other, important reason.

## When _No_ Doesn't Work

I say a version of _no_ frequently. And, even more frequently, I ask _why_. I'm sure I occasionally sound like a child, but it's effective.

Sometimes I concede to _no_ rebuttals, and I'd do it for one of two reasons.

First, while I may feel the situation at hand warrants a _no_ response, if it is rebutted, it may be more worthwhile to back down for the sake of keeping a human relationship in good standing. Maintaining a health human relationship (remember the _don't be a dick_ thing?) is far superior to winning an argument.

Second, factors outside a human relationship may be at play. If it's your boss, I still suggest you push them when you can, but you don't want to lose your job over a dispute. Or if it's a client disputing a charge, you don't want to bring a lawsuit upon yourself. There are all sorts of other factors at play. It takes weighing these to help you decide if it's okay to back down once you've begun the process of saying _no_.

In contrast to this, sometimes you should hold your ground. You do not want to be the person who starts to say _no_ and then never actually gets what they wanted. Whether it's your boss, your insurance agent, or your spouse, you need to earn the desired result from an argument every so often.

There are tricky situations here. Again, I wouldn't recommend ever letting a dispute at your office become so large that you get fired. At the same time, if your boss never lets you win an argument, then maybe you should find somewhere else to work.

By the way, I say _let you win_ because often one of the arguers holds status over the other. In those case, it really does take the arguer demonstrating _humility_ and _listening_ to what you're saying.

## What _No_ Can Do For You

If you learn to say _no_ effectively, you're bound to be a happier person. I don't even have to give you an example. Just think of your own life. Think of a time when you said _yes_ when you could have said _no_, and how unhappy you were with the result.

I've even found that some people nearly fantasize about saying _no_. I've come to tell you it's honestly not that big of a deal. Just do it. I don't mean be a little firmer, I mean actually try saying _no_. It will be terrifying, but I think you'll be astounded by the reaction you elicit from the person to whom you are speaking.

And with the same vigor you use to say _no_ so powerfully, say _yes_ occasionally. Act excited to do something for someone else when doing that thing is mutually beneficial.

## How To React To _No_

It's great to be all powerful and everything, but what happens when someone says _no_ to you? More importantly, what do you do if you are in the position of power (where you could simply overrule the _no_)?

It's simple. Just _listen_. If they tell you _why_, great! If not, ask _why_.

Once you know why that person said _no_ to you, evaluate that _why_. Does it make logical sense? If it happens in your workplace, does it make business sense?

If it makes sense, learn any additional information you may need, then say _okay_ and move on.

On the other hand, if the _why_ has no value (in your mind), fight back. Again, do this diplomatically. Be firm when you need to be firm, and lay back and talk it through when the situation calls for it.
