Likely all of us use at least one [Google product](http://www.google.com/about/products/) to enhance our experience on the web, whether we may realize it or not. But, don't forget [how Google got started](http://www.google.com/about/company/history). Google's search engine is still the most valuable product they deliver and maintain.

## Using Google's Search Engine To Make Yourself Look Smart

I like to solve problems. Often I find myself helping employees throughout my office with various tasks. I occasionally hear the phrase, "You're smart." I always immediately think, _I'm not smart, I just know how to use google._

Now, granted, it takes time, effort, and practice to _be good at googling_, as funny as that sounds. But it's not that difficult. And the results of this small amount of effort are invaluable. It will actually make you smarter -- you may learn something you didn't know. But it may also change the way others perceive you -- you'll appear smart and proactive, and that makes you valuable.

Here's my philosophy:

### When You Should Use Google

Google is my answer to a lot of questions, but it's not always the answer. It's usually a good solution if:

- There's no one around to help you
- You've asked the question before (maybe you could ask the person again, but write it down this time (asking the same question more than once is super annoying to the answerer)
- The people around you are likely to not have the answer you're seeking

Google isn't always the answer. Sometimes:

- Someone around you can answer much faster (usually good to at least ask if you haven't asked the question before)
- You just have to try a solution (often a better way to learn)

### Become A Pro Googler

It seems like Google gets better every day at providing relevant results. And, like I said, it takes some work to being a Pro Googler. Sometimes that means creating processes that help you avoid duplicating Google searches.

#### Log in to Google

Make Google work for you. If you haven't already, [get yourself a Google account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp). Even if you don't use their other services, stay signed in while you peruse the web. Google is watching you, and they'll use your web habits and interests to help return relevant search results. You think it's creepy? Get over it. They're providing you a service. FREE! Use it and you'll be surprised how much your search results improve.

#### Use Evernote

[Evernote](http://evernote.com/) has a [web clipper](http://evernote.com/webclipper/) that lets you save web pages to your Evernote account (as notes). This means when you find a web page you're going to use again, you don't have to type any notes, and you don't have to maintain a list of bookmarks.

#### Record answers

If you don't like Evernote and don't like googling the same thing twice, that not a problem. Save your answers. Seriously. Many times I go through 5-10 web pages before finding exactly what I'm looking for. Now, if I don't save that answer, I'm going to look through those same pages again. But if I save it, and I come across the same problem, I know I've recorded the answer.

For the record, I don't use Evernote, although I used to. Googling is so fast it's often quicker for me to just google the same thing twice. For simple solutions, I usually just know I'll google it again if I forget the answer. For more complex answers, or for answers that were farther down the results list, I'll save them. Usually I save complex solutions by writing a blog post.

#### Use actionable and powerful words

Google recognizes which words are used and reused and reused again, so they ignore them. And not just words like "a" or "the." Want to know *how to play the piano?* It may actually be more useful to use the word _learn_ than _how to_. If I search _how to play the piano,_ only six of the top ten results include the words "how to" in their title or description. But if I search _learn to play piano,_ every result in the top ten have _learn_ in their title or description.

#### Reword unsuccessful searches

The answer for your question is most likely out there. But Google isn't perfect. As much as you may like to believe, Google can't actually read your mind. So be creative and reword unsuccessful searches. Think of some synonyms to your search. You can do what you'd like, but I tend to only try three of the top five results, and if I don't find what I want, I start a new search.

#### A little critical thinking and forum activity

Even if Google does get you to the best results, it's not to say the best results are going to solve your problem. In some cases, be prepared to translate someone's problem to how it helps you. In other cases, you may find nothing at all. So, instead, look for user forums for the _subject_ you're searching. One likely exists. Join and post your question.

## Have A Little Fun

Happy googling! And just remember, if you become the expert, and if people start asking you stupid questions, there's always [Let Me Google That For You](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+google) to help you give people a hard time. To make it work, just add `?q=your+question` -- [http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+google) -- and watch it go to work.
