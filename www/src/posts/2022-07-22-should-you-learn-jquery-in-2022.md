I came across [a tweet](https://twitter.com/Nikoletta3108/status/1478076511710322699) that raised this question. It made me stop and think. _jQuery? Really?_ It’s 2022.

Curious about its usage today, I did some light googling.

## jQuery is _Widely_ Used

[W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/) reports jQuery being used on at least one page in [77.4% of the top 10 million websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library) (at the time of writing this), or 94.8% of sites using at least one common JS library.

In contrast, React — which we hear _much_ more about on Twitter — is used in only 2.9% of those sites. Even Lodash and Moment — super popular libraries that whose popularity has faded in recent years — both sit below 5%.

jQuery is still _widely_ used. _Far_ more than any other JavaScript library.

## Working on New Projects

That said, it’s become irrelevant with the advent of component-driven libraries like React, Vue, and others. If you work exclusively on new projects (which sounds like a dream), you may be able to avoid working with jQuery.

## Supporting Legacy Projects

But, chances are high that you’re going to come across jQuery at some point in your career. It’s not likely to be on a new project. It may be in supporting a legacy project. It may be in having to look through old code while building a new website. It may be that a single page has some legacy behavior that a client doesn’t want to replace, and you have to support it.

Whatever it may be, you’ll probably encounter it at some point.

## The Verdict on jQuery in 2022

If a dev asked me if they should learn jQuery today, I’d say no. Don’t _learn_ it. But be _familiar_ with it. Know it exists and understand the general syntax enough to recognize it.

If you have to work with it, use [the docs](https://jquery.com/) and countless other resources around the web to learn jQuery more deeply, only as much as needed to support your work.

There’s so much changing all the time in front-end development, you don’t need another thing to proactively learn.
