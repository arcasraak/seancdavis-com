Long story short, it's Amazon â€” there are [way too many ways to set credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html).

Though my preferred method is not the recommended way, I find that it plays well with setting other environment-based values for your application. That is by using [environment variables](/blog/wtf-is-environment-variable/).

The [AWS SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) automatically [looks for your credentials in environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-environment.html). You can set the following values:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Then it'll just work, like magic!

A big benefit to this approach is that you can have multiple projects on your machine and set these values contextually based on the project you're working with.
