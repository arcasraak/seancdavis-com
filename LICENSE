Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of
this code and its corresponding content, to copy, modify, and distribute in
any way, under the following conditions:

1. Outright copying ...

2. Altering the code or content for malicious purposes is not permitted.

1. You may not copy my brand directly. You can use it for inspiration. But
please don't up and lift it for your own, at least without asking first. I'm
also happy to put you in touch with the designer who created it.

2. If you copy and publish wholesale articles, you must recognize my article the
original by [adding a canonical meta
tag](https://moz.com/learn/seo/canonicalization) to yours.

3. While you don't have to credit me (although I'd be forever grateful if you
did), I'd love for you to share your work with me. I like knowing that what I'm
doing is helping, and that's a great way to give back for what you've received.

4. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND




TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION:

1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

   - Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
   - Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's
     REALLY being a dick.
   - Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would
     make you a PROPER dick.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or
   supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads
   off this work and not buy the original work's creator(s) a pint.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching
   when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A
   non-dick would submit the fix back.
